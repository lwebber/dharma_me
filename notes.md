# things to do
1. check other gems for file organization--change mine to CLI.cll
2. finish talk scraper
3. make meditation scraper more abstract - right now it's fixed to 8 meditations. what if the number of meditations in that section grows?
4. Make sure I've got list and detail views. Right now, detail view is Play. What if that also included details about what's playing?
5. Add "more by the same teacher?" functionality
6. check for "sandwich code", which is the misuse of each vs. collect - each sets up an empty array, fills it, then returns the array.
7. make breathe abstract by adding "how long?" option and calculating how long method should run.
8. What's that double-colon namespace thing?
9. if [Q].include?(input.upcase) -normalize to accept upper or lower case q
10. what's the difference between nokogiri .css and .search methods?
11. split cli code into intro, menu, goodbye
12. look up how to use nokogiri with RSS feeds (or other RSS reader)
13. refactor play to use the system open method
14. Talks have teachers and teachers have many talks (or even meditations)
15. Revise variable names to be super specific "artist_data" for the set of artist data rather than just artist, for instance
16. Do I have "find" and "save" methods?
17. Figure out file structure
18. Use a module? Or just inheritance? a lot of repeated code between Talk and Meditation
